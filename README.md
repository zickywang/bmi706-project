## Overview

We created this web application to visualize the COVID data curated by Our World in Data (https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data). 

More information on this project, including the dataset, design process, and future directions can be found in our process book (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1i_3jU6BGdXlwlTevqui0dZITAtjguDSoFfbskwVyst4/edit?usp=sharing).
